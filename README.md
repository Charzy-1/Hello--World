# Hello-World
Am using this repository called "Hello-World" to say hello to the world of coders as i have come to join the community. It's a thing of joy to be here and i believe it's a place worth being. I look forward to meeting great coders, expecially those in the "Data Science World".

I'm Charles but preffered to be called Charzy as it will be a great name am noturing. I like honest people and people that are selfless.
